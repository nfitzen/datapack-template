# Datapack Template

## Instructions for use

- Replace this file with [README.tmpl.md](README.tmpl.md)
- Edit the [dep5 file](.reuse/dep5) and replace and add copyright as necessary.
    - Hopefully, it should be drag-and-drop (since dep5 doesn't apply if the
    file doesn't exist), unless you're using Lantern.
- See the [REUSE initiative](//reuse.software/) for more information on
    .license files etc.
